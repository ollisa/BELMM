# BELMM: Baesian Estimation of Latent Mixture Models

### Description
BELMM is a framework for analyzing, clustering, and modelling time-series data in a Bayesian setting. The basic idea of the approach is to treat the individual mixture components as realizations of latent random walk processes. The models are estimated using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/index.html) and Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo implemented in [CU-MSDSp](https://github.com/jtchavisIII/CU-MSDSp) is used for model selection. 

### Purpose
This is a repository for supplementary material for "BELMM; Bayesian model selection and random walk smoothing in time-series clustering".
