# BELMM: Baesian Estimation of Latent Mixture Models

### Description
BELMM is a framework for analyzing, clustering, and modelling time-series data in a Bayesian setting. The basic idea of the approach is to treat the individual mixture components as realizations of latent random walk processes. The models are estimated using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/index.html) and the model selection is done using Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo implemented in [CU-MSDSp](https://github.com/jtchavisIII/CU-MSDSp). 

### Purpose
This is a repository for supplementary material for "BELMM: Bayesian model selection and random walk smoothing in time-series clustering". For details, please refer to the paper and the associated attachment. Code for data simulation, data processing, and analysing and plotting the results, see *BELMM_R_file.Rmd*. The Stan implementations of the models can be found under *models* folder. For instructions, see *Tutorial*. Additional information is provided at the end of the Supplementary material. The associated files can be found under folder *example*.
